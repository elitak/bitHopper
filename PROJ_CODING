Bithopper Coding Style

INDENTS
4 spaces per indent. Don't use tab characters. Don't use 3 spaces.

COMMENTS
Comments are really nice. Docstrings are also nice. We don't have enough of either.

ADDING A NEW FEATURE
I prefer new features be added as new files and modules. If they can't reasonably be
done like that or fit within a current module use that. If in doubt ask.

As much as possible please leave core modules as they are and extend via "hooks"
and plugins. To see an example plugin see plugins/hookexample/__init__.py

Convention for adding new plugin configuration to bh.cfg is to prefix with "plugin."
Convention is to use __init__.py to bootstrap the plugin and the bulk of the logic
go into a seperate .py file. This makes it easier to work with multiple plugins.

WHY DOES POOL.PY DO EVERYTHING?
Because I haven't had time to split it and clean it up.

bH could support scraping after logging in with mechanize (http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/)
Small script example included
