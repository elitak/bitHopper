# Instructions

In order to run bithopper you need twisted phython installed:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

Copy pool.cfg.default to a new file called pool.cfg then modify the new
file to include your bitcoin addresses, and pool passwords, instead of mine.

If you don't want to use a pool give it an invalid password, or go to localhost:8337/stats and switch its role to disable, or just delete it.

Run python bitHopper.py

It listens on localhost:8337.  So you should direct your miner to
localhost:8337.

# Windows installation
