# Ubuntu installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Use python2.7. There have been bugs with pythongit on 2.6

Run:

sudo apt-get install python2.7 git python2.7-dev python-setuptools python-pip libevent-dev 
sudo pip install gevent setuptools gitpython httplib2 --upgrade
git clone git://github.com/c00w/bitHopper.git
cd bitHopper
python bitHopper.py

Tested and working in Ubuntu 11.10.

# Other Linux Installations
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Use pip to install your libraries. We need fairly recent versions of everything.
The libraries bundled with debian are too old.


# Instructions for Windows users
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOTS OF MINERS USE LINUX.
It's a lot more stable and takes less modifications.

# Configuring user settings

Worker Configuration page: http://localhost:8337/worker
BitHopper Stats page: http://localhost:8337/stats

Copy "user.cfg.default" to a new file called "user.cfg" then modify the new file to have correct pool roles.
Ignore the usernames and passwords. Configure the usernames and passwords on http://localhost:8337/worker

Repeat with "bh.cfg.default" and make sure default values work for you.
Run "python bitHopper.py" in *nix or in Windows you can double click on run-bithopper.bat. After script
updates info check if the pools have been added correctly to your stats page.

If any of the pools turns red or there is something else missing then edit your "user.cfg" accordingly.

If you don't want to use a pool delete it from "user.cfg" or go to Stats page and switch its role to
disable. BitHopper listens on loopback interface so you should direct your miner to localhost:8337
with any username and password (not blank).

If you would like to use custom settings with some pools check out "pools.cfg" for examples and then
put your settings into "pools-custom.cfg". This way you can always update to latest "pools.cfg"
and also experiment with new pools or use different api sources for shares scraping.


# LP tuning / dashboard

LP Workbench: http://localhost:8337/lpworkbench

See:
 Block Hash, Owner, LP Timings as deltas against winning "owner".
You can view the list of active pools, override owner and have easy access to adjust LP penalties


# Switches

You can launch bitHopper with the following parameters (some get overwriten at runtime by the ones
you set-up in "bh.cfg"):

   --ip                  = IP to listen on
   --port                = Port to listen on
   --auth                = Ask for user and password on stats page (--auth user,pass)
   --config              = Select an alternate main config file from "bh.cfg"
   --listschedulers      = List alternate schedulers available
   --scheduler           = Select an alternate scheduler
   --threshold           = Override difficulty threshold (default 0.43)
   --p2pLP               = Starts up an IRC bot to validate LP based hopping
   --debug               = Extra error output. Basically print all caught errors
   --trace               = Extra debugging output
   --logconnections      = Show connection log


# Available Schedulers:

   DefaultScheduler

A none slicing scheduler. May actually be the best scheduler there is.

   SimpleSliceScheduler

The time based default scheduler. All that matters is time and it tries to be completely fair across all
pools. A little less effective but thoroughly debugged.

   AltSliceScheduler

Tries to be more aggressive at switching pools when thresholds are met rather than finishing a slice.
You can find some more specific parameters to set-up in "bh.cfg.default" file.

   RoundTimeScheduler

Not currently in use.

   RoundTimeDynamicPenaltyScheduler

Not currently in use.


# Skins

You can change the color scheme on the status page. Skins and .jpg preview are located in the StatSkin sub directory.
Just rename your choice to index.html and copy to the main directory to change skin. (Current version requires you to restart bH)
Tested and working on the following browsers: Firefox 6 (Win 7; Android); Chrome 13 (Win 7)
Known issues with the following browsers: WebKit (Android 2.3.4); Internet Explorer 9 (Win 7)

# Donations

If you think this project is cool and you want features added and bugs hunted down then consider making a p2p donation, anything counts ;)
or have "Donation" pool enabled in your stats page (setup donation percent in your "pools.cfg" - default 1%)
